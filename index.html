        <h3>A Short History</h3>
        <p>
          We all associate croissants with France but, surprisingly, they
          originated in Austria. This buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie
          pastry was inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but uses the
          French yeast-leavened laminated dough instead. The modern croissant
          was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced
          the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
          dough.

              <p>
                In France, croissants are generally sold without filling and
                eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.
                They are a symbol of classic French patisserie baking and loved
                by all ages all around the world.

                In Italy, the croissant is known as a 'cornetto'. They often
                come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings, or filled
                with various delicious creams and jams, such as crema
                pasticciera (custard), apricot jam, chocolate cream, hazelnut
                cream or pistachio cream. Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is
                one of the most common breakfasts in Italy.

                In Spain, the croissant is know as a 'cruas√°n'. It usually eaten
                in a caf√® for elevenses with a caf√® con leche. The Spanish
                croissant is topped with a sugary syrup and usually unfilled and
                dunked in your cup of coffee and you enjoy a break on a terrace
                in the sun.
