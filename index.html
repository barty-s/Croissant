      We all associate croissants with France but, surprisingly, they originated
      in Austria. This buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry was inspired
      by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but uses the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough instead. The modern croissant was developed in the early
      20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
      with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.

            In France, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten
            without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling. They are a
            symbol of classic French patisserie baking and loved by all ages all
            around the world.

            In Italy, the croissant is known as a 'cornetto'. They often come
            covered with powdered sugar or other toppings, or filled with
            various delicious creams and jams, such as crema pasticciera
            (custard), apricot jam, chocolate cream, hazelnut cream or pistachio
            cream. Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is one of the most common
            breakfasts in Italy.

            In Spain, the croissant is know as a 'cruas√°n'. It usually eaten in
            a caf√® for elevenses with a caf√® con leche. The Spanish croissant is
            topped with a sugary syrup and usually unfilled and dunked in your
            cup of coffee and you enjoy a break on a terrace in the sun.
