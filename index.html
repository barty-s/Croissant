    <h2>A favourite breakfast treat around Europe</h2>

      We all associate croissants with France but, surprisingly, they originated
      in Austria. This buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry was inspired
      by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but uses the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough instead. The modern croissant was developed in the early
      20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
      with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.

      In France, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without
      added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.

      In Italy, the croissant is known as a 'cornetto'. They often come covered
      with powdered sugar or other toppings, or filled with various delicious
      creams and jams, such as crema pasticciera (custard), apricot jam,
      chocolate cream, hazelnut cream or pistachio cream. Cornetto with
      cappuccino at the bar is one of the most common breakfasts in Italy.

      In Spain, the croissant is know as a 'cruas√°n'. It usually eaten in a caf√®
      for elevenses with a caf√® con leche. The Spanish croissant is topped with
      a sugary syrup and usually unfilled and dunked in your cup of coffee and
      you enjoy a break on a terrace in the sun.
